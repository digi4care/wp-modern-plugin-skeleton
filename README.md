## 🚀 Quick Start: Create a New Plugin

### Option 1: Using GitHub Template

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository
2. Name your new repository (e.g., `my-awesome-plugin`)
3. Clone your new repository locally

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository (don't fork it!)
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/digi4care/wp-modern-plugin-skeleton.git my-awesome-plugin
cd my-awesome-plugin

# Remove the existing git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize a new git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-awesome-plugin.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install JavaScript dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Plugin

1. **First, update `composer.json`**:

    - Open `composer.json`
    - Update these fields:

        ```json
        {
            "name": "your-vendor/your-plugin-slug",
            "description": "Your plugin description",
            "authors": [
                {
                    "name": "Your Name",
                    "email": "your.email@example.com"
                }
            ],
            "extra": {
                "plugin-name": "Your Plugin Name",
                "plugin-uri": "https://your-plugin-url.com",
                "text-domain": "your-plugin-slug"
            }
        }
        ```

2. **Run the initialization script**:

    ```bash
    # This will use the values from composer.json to set up everything
    composer init-plugin
    ```

    The script will automatically:

    - Create your main plugin file with proper headers
    - Set up the frontend package.json
    - Configure the CI/CD workflow
    - Generate all necessary configuration files

    You only need to update `composer.json` - all other files will be generated automatically based on these settings.

## 🧰 Available Commands

### Development Commands

#### Testing & Quality Assurance

```bash
# Run all PHPUnit tests
composer test
# - Verifies your code works as expected
# - Tests are located in the 'tests/' directory
# - Creates code coverage reports in 'coverage/'

# Check code style against WordPress Coding Standards
composer cs
# - Validates your code follows WordPress coding standards
# - Helps maintain consistent code style across the project
# - Will show errors and warnings for style violations

# Automatically fix code style issues
composer cbf
# - Fixes most code style issues automatically
# - Safe to run as it only changes formatting, not logic
# - Run this after 'composer cs' to fix reported issues

# Static code analysis with PHPStan
composer stan
# - Analyzes code for potential bugs and issues
# - Checks type safety and finds dead code
# - More thorough than basic syntax checking

# Run all checks (tests, code style, static analysis)
composer check
# - One command to run all quality checks
# - Perfect before committing code
# - Ensures all quality gates pass
```

#### Why WordPress Core in Development?

WordPress core is installed in the `wordpress/` directory for development purposes only. This helps with:

1. **Testing**: Run unit and integration tests without needing a full WordPress installation
2. **Code Completion**: Your IDE can provide better autocompletion and type hints
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures all WordPress functions and classes are available during development
4. **Isolation**: Keeps your development environment self-contained

This is a development-only dependency (in `require-dev` in `composer.json`) and won't be included in your production build.

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Development

- Work in `/src` for PHP code
- Work in `/frontend` for JavaScript/React code
- Use `npm run dev` in the frontend directory for live development

### 2. Version Management

#### English

Manage your plugin version easily using Composer commands:

```bash
# Bump patch version (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
composer version:patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
composer version:minor

# Bump major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
composer version:major
```

These commands will:

1. Update the version in `composer.json`
2. Update the version in your plugin header
3. Create a git commit with the version bump
4. Create a git tag for the new version

### 3. Frontend Package Management

The `bin/update-frontend-package.php` script ensures your frontend's `package.json` stays in sync with your plugin's configuration. It automatically:

- Updates the package name to match your plugin name
- Syncs the version number with your plugin version
- Preserves essential frontend dependencies and scripts

#### How It Works

1. **Automatic Execution**: Runs automatically when you initialize a new plugin using `composer init-plugin`
2. **Configuration Preservation**: Maintains critical frontend settings:
    - Build scripts (`dev`, `build`, `preview`)
    - Required dependencies (React, WordPress i18n)
    - Development tooling (Vite, Tailwind CSS)

#### Manual Execution

If you need to update the frontend package manually:

```bash
php bin/update-frontend-package.php
```

This is useful if you've made changes to your plugin's name or version and need to sync these changes to the frontend configuration.

### 4. Building for Production

```bash
# 1. Build frontend assets
cd frontend
npm run build

# 2. Go back to root and create distribution
cd ..
./build/build.sh  # Creates a clean build in dist/
```

### 4. Creating a Release

1. Bump the version (see above)
2. Push your changes and tags:

    ```bash
    git push && git push --tags
    ```

3. GitHub Actions will automatically create a release with the built plugin

### 5. Testing the Build

You can test the built plugin by copying the contents of the `dist/` directory to your WordPress plugins directory.

## 🧱 Gutenberg Blocks

This plugin includes a modern block development environment with the following features:

- 🚀 Automatic block registration
- ⚡ Lazy loading (only loads when Gutenberg is active)
- 🔄 Hot module replacement in development
- 🎨 Built-in support for React and modern JavaScript

### Block Structure

Each block should be placed in its own directory under `frontend/blocks/` with this structure:

```text
block-name/
├── src/
│   ├── edit.js    # Editor component
│   ├── save.js    # Frontend component
│   ├── index.js   # Block registration
│   └── style.scss # Block styles
└── block.json     # Block configuration
```

### Creating a New Block

1. **Create a new directory** for your block in `frontend/blocks/`

2. **Add a `block.json` file**:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/block.json",
        "apiVersion": 3,
        "name": "your-plugin/block-name",
        "title": "Block Name",
        "category": "widgets",
        "icon": "smiley",
        "editorScript": "file:./build/index.js"
    }
    ```

3. **Create the block components**:

    - `edit.js` - Controls the block's appearance in the editor
    - `save.js` - Controls the block's output on the frontend
    - `index.js` - Registers the block

4. **The block will be automatically registered** when Gutenberg is active

### Block Development

```bash
# Start development server with HMR
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep blocks independent** - Each block should work on its own
2. **Use WordPress components** - Leverage `@wordpress/components` when possible
3. **Lazy load assets** - Only load what's needed for each block
4. **Support i18n** - Use `@wordpress/i18n` for translatable strings

### Example Block

See `frontend/blocks/example-block/` for a complete example. You can use this as a starting point for your own blocks.

## 🎨 Frontend Development

The frontend is built using React with Vite. The main entry points are:

- `frontend/main.jsx` - Application entry point
- `frontend/App.jsx` - Root React component
- `frontend/components/` - Reusable React components
- `frontend/translations/` - Translation files

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Build for production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Check for issues**:

   ```bash
   npm run lint    # Check code style
   npm run typecheck  # Type checking
   ```

### Managing Frontend Dependencies

- Add new dependencies using npm:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install package-name
  ```

- Update dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm update
  ```

### Styling

- Main styles are located in `frontend/index.css`
- Block-specific styles should be placed in their respective block directories
- Uses PostCSS with modern CSS features
- Supports CSS Modules for component-scoped styles

The frontend is built using React with Vite. The main entry points are:

- `frontend/main.jsx` - Application entry point
- `frontend/App.jsx` - Root React component
- `frontend/components/` - Reusable React components
- `frontend/translations/` - Translation files

Run the development server with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Start the development environment**:

   ```bash
   # Install PHP dependencies
   composer install
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Running Tests**:

   ```bash
   # Run PHPUnit tests
   composer test
   
   # Run PHPStan (static analysis)
   composer stan
   
   # Check code style
   composer cs
   ```

### Building for Production

1. **Build the frontend assets**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create a production build**:

   ```bash
   # From the project root
   ./build/build.sh
   ```

   This will create a production-ready build in the `dist/` directory.

### Version Management

Use Composer to manage versions:

```bash
# Bump patch version (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
composer version:patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
composer version:minor

# Bump major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
composer version:major
```

These commands will update the version in `composer.json`, update the plugin header, create a git commit, and tag the release.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

This project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically:

- Run tests on every push
- Check code style
- Perform static analysis
- Build the plugin on tags

## 📦 Creating a Release

1. Update the version in `composer.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Commit your changes
4. Create a git tag:

    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```

5. GitHub Actions will automatically create a release with the built plugin
